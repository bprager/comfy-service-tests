# Vibe steering

This folder captures the lightweight steering docs used during "vibe coding" sessions. Keep them short and update them often. They are intended to prevent drift and to keep experiments aligned with the feasibility goals.

## How to use
- Start sessions by scanning `GOALS.md` and `CONSTRAINTS.md`.
- Add new decisions to `DECISIONS.md` when a tradeoff is made.
- Record unknowns or blockers in `QUESTIONS.md`.
