# Goals

- Demonstrate a control-plane + data-plane split for ComfyUI-style execution.
- Keep the UI behavior and workflow JSON compatible with the existing ComfyUI frontend.
- Use Go + Imagick (ImageMagick MagickWand) for image operations.
- Validate coarse-grained stage services instead of per-node microservices.
- Measure feasibility: latency, resource usage, and operational complexity.
